# Bittensor Subnet Mining
Bittensor Subnet Mining for my University Thesis  
🚧 Under Construction 🚧

## Overview
This repository is part of my university thesis research on **Bittensor subnet mining**.  
The project explores the process, performance, and implications of mining within the Bittensor ecosystem.

## Objectives
- Study the architecture of Bittensor and its subnet system.  
- Set up and configure a subnet miner/validator.  
- Collect and analyze mining performance data.  
- Contribute findings to academic research on decentralized AI and compute networks.

## Work in Progress
- [ ] Literature review on Bittensor and decentralized AI.  
- [ ] Setup of mining environment.  
- [ ] Experiments with subnet mining.  
- [ ] Data analysis and evaluation.  
- [ ] Thesis documentation.
